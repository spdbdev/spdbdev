## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a longstanding love for everything tech. I currently work as a Full Stack Software Engineer in what I absolutely love: JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js, Ruby, PHP and GraphQL. Iâ€™m involved in the entire process of software development, from initial conception to development, testing, implementation, and maintenance. I love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code. I also strive to keep up with the latest trends in web development.
